# 🌦 Telangana Weather Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

This project presents a detailed **weather analytics dashboard** for the state of Telangana, built using **Power BI**.  
It brings together **rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind speed** data to understand long-term and seasonal climate patterns across **districts, mandals, and years**.

The dashboard is designed not just to show charts but to **tell a meaningful story about Telangana’s changing weather**, making it useful for:
- climate and environmental studies,
- agricultural planning,
- policy insights,
- data storytelling and portfolio building.
